# Contributing

There are a variety of different ways to contribute. We ask that you follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow these guidelines when creating a contribution.

## Getting Started

A good first step to learn more about this project is to check out our docs located in the wiki section of Github. The 
docs are intended to provide helpful information to both users and contributors. Our docs could always be better so if
you think they are lacking somewhere, check out the [documentation](#documentation) section to help up improve.

Another great way to get started is to join our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/parameterized-builds/Lobby)! 
Introduce yourself and we'll do our best to assist you towards your first or latest contribution.

## Code Style and Best Practices

This project uses [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) as a Java code linter. The 
linting rules are as follows:

- Max line length is 100 characters
- Indentation is done with 4 spaces
- Star imports are discouraged

In addition, any code written should be accompanied by unit tests.

## Contribution Types

### Bug Reports

Bug reports should be submitted through a Github issue. Follow the [issue template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to provide an
appropriate amount of information in your report.

### Bug Fixes

Before fixing a bug, make sure there is a bug report open. If not, please open one so that the issue can be tracked.
Once an issue is open, mention in the issue that you would like to work on it so we can see where work is being done.

### Documentation

Minor documentation updates such as typo fixes do not need approval to make. More significant updates like adding a 
new page or a new section to a page should first be approved by a code owner. A request can be made through Gitter and a 
core member will then work with you to make the update.
